Describe the difference between a GameObject and a Component in Unity.
 
 A GameObject is the fundamental object in Unity's scene hierarchy.
It acts as a container for components and can represent characters, items, lights, cameras, etc.
A GameObject does not contain any visible content by itself; 
it is a container for components that define its behavior, appearance, and functionality.
A Component is a script or module attached to a GameObject to give it specific functionality.
Components define the behavior, appearance, and characteristics of a GameObject.
Examples of components include scripts (written in C# or JavaScript), colliders, renderers, audio sources, and more.
